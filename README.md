Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
1.Context:
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

2.Content:
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.

3.About Data:
This is a dataset containing credit card transactions with 31 features and a class label. The features represent various aspects of the transaction, and the class label indicates whether the transaction was fraudulent (class 1) or not (class 0).

The first feature is "Time", which represents the number of seconds elapsed between the transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The next 28 features, V1 to V28, are anonymized variables resulting from a principal component analysis (PCA) transformation of the original features. They represent different aspects of the transaction, such as the amount, location, and type of transaction.

The second last feature is "Amount", which represents the transaction amount in USD. The last feature is the "Class" label, which indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent (class 1) or not (class 0).

Overall, this dataset is used to train machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. The features are used to train the model to learn patterns in the data, which can then be used to detect fraudulent transactions in future transactions.
